Tests that gxref ignores attributes that should be ignored.
Basic test case.  
Two signals appear on page 1 that should be cross-ref'ed.
One component on page 1 has no netname attr, and should be ignored.
One component on page 1 has no xref attr, and should be ignored.
One signal appears on page 2.
Page 2 has no numsheets attr, which should be benign.
One signal appears on page 3.
----
xref attributes should be updated on all sheets where the
component also has a netname.
numsheets attribute should be udpated on sheets 1 and 3.
